                <p class="post-summary">The technology exhibit organized by KTS members at Bahir dar University was completed successfully.</p>

                    <h2 class="post-title">The why</h2>
                    <p>Well, it all started in a members meeting one day. We were discussing the enthusiasm, or lack there of, campus students have towards technology in general. After all it is a technology institution yet no one seemed to care. “How do we change this?”, “how do we get the community to get involved in tech?” we said. Among many other solutions, this event came up. Considering the short time we had left in that academic year, we decided to go with it.</p>
                    <h2>The main elements</h2>
                    <p>Like any event, ours had to have a central idea, something it stands for. So after thinking and talking it through, we went with a theme of showcasing, preferably with tangible and physical items, the latest and greatest tech products. We prioritized exciting and trendy options like AI, VR and drones. We wanted this event to stick in out fellow students’ minds, to make it something worth talking about with your friends. And that we did!</p>

                <h2 class="post-title">My best (and worst) reads of 2023</h2>
                <p class="post-summary">Reading a book which is surprisingly still done by a lot of people is an excellent way to spend your leisure time. Not all books are great tho and sometimes you only learn that 50 pages in. In this post I will share some of the greatest (and worst) books I came across in 2023.</p>

                    <h2 class="post-title">48 Laws of Power - Robert Greene</h2>
                    <p>48 Laws of Power - Robert Greene I was drawn into this book because of the repeated appraisals (and warnings) I received from my friends. The way I was informed about it, as a sort of a mythical book that uncovers the dark arts of manipulation, made my experience with it a bit dull. A number of laws mentioned here are common sense, but some leave you wondering how many chances you’ve let pass you just because you were not aware of other perception. Also, the way Robert mentions historical figures to support his claims makes it all the more interesting. If you’re going to read this one, remember, best things are saved for last. Be sure to finish it and mark the last works of the author.</p>
                    <h2 class="post-title">12 Rules for Life - Jordan Peterson</h2>
                    <p>After some of the past years controversies, everyone knows JP. He is a clinical psychologist with, among other things, a deep insight on biblical stories and what lessons to draw from them. I read this book after listening to some of his lectures on YouTube. While his book is not as enticing as his videos, it’s much more educational and leaves you with a richer understanding of his view on life. The only reason I put it here and not on the GOATs list is because JP fails to keep his readers hooked in to the book long enough for them to take the lesson. If you don’t get bored easily and are willing to go through some uninteresting pages to get to the gem, then this is definitely a good read for you.</p>

                <h2 class="post-title">Let's talk about Nothing</h2>
                <p class="post-summary">A new player in the smartphone market is not something you see everyday. In fact, big players like LG have given up and quit. So how did a new and relatively small company like Nothing manage to pull it off?</p>

                    <h2 class="post-title">Let's talk about Nothing</h2>
                    <p>The smartphone market is one of the most stabilized markets with most customers already being loyal to a certain brand or ecosystem. Most just buy the latest iPhone or Galaxy phone out. While that, in and of itself, is a testament on how well this companies have mastered their craft and how well built their products are, it also makes it almost impossible for new companies to penetrate the market and find a market share.<br><br>Current big names in the market include Samsung, Apple, Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo, OnePlus, Google and so on. This are companies that have been in the game for quite some years. There is however a new name that has been making some noise since 2021. The company named ‘Nothing’ founded by former OnePlus co-founder Carl Pei, started off by shipping wireless earbuds, the ear (1). Then proceeded to release their first phone, the Nothing Phone (1) on August of last year. Currently they have already shipped the second generation of both their phone and their earbuds.</p>
                    <h2>Marketing (beyond the hype pumping)</h2>
                    <p>Their CEO is a youtuber..? well technically he is just “featured” on their videos but he practically takes most of the screen time. Actively engaging with the community, reacting to what popular reviewers say about his product and sometimes even hosting critics so as to improve products. This makes him relatable and I think it plays a significant role in building brand trust among consumers.</p>

                    <h2 class="post-title">Teachers vs Online mentors</h2>
                    <p>And then there’s the instructors, masters of their craft breaking down complex concepts, teaching them, giving them away. It all just belittled school in my eyes. All my years at high school were spent this way, spending 8 hours a day at school without even believing in it.</p>
                    <h2 class="post-title">Skill building</h2>
                    <p>I shifted my attention to skill building and since I was really into art and design, I started taking online courses. Graphic design, photo editing, video editing, motion graphics and VFX I tried them all. I can’t say I pushed any of them far enough at least at the time, but it made my conviction against schooling even stronger. Seeing these immensely educating videos, accessing them for free.</p>
