            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <div class="about-paragraph">
                <h2>My Background</h2>
                <p>My world revolves around computers. Not just the sleek devices, but the hidden language that breathes life into them. This fascination didn't truly click until a gap year spent exploring the vast web. Witnessing how code crafts solutions and empowers businesses sparked a fire within me. I realized the key to building these digital landscapes was just knowledge and passion. So, I dove headfirst into computer science, starting with the powerful but unforgiving C++. It honed my skills and made me acutely aware of technology's influence, both positive and negative. One such revelation was when I discovered that I can manipulate the memory pixels of a computer modifying its color, making software accessible to color-blind users â€“ a tangible impact that solidified my mission to code with purpose, to build with empathy.</p>

            <div class="about-paragraph">
                <h2>Drawn by the possibilities of web development</h2>
                <p>Fueled by my C++ mastery, I sought a domain where I could directly impact people. Web development presented the perfect blend of creativity and logic, building bridges between users and information. To solidify my foundations, I tackled Harvard's CS50 alongside my university studies. It was a year of intense learning, pushing me beyond my comfort zone. But with each hurdle overcome, my confidence in the code grew. This culminated in GUSH as CS50 final project, an inventory management system built with Python and Flask, empowering businesses to take control of their stock.</p>

            <div class="about-paragraph">
                <h2>Further into the Web development</h2>
                <p>Fueled by CS50's rigorous curriculum, I absorbed concepts like abstraction, algorithms, and data structures, understanding how code shapes the world around us. My grip on languages like C, Python, and SQL tightened, while HTML and CSS became extensions of my creativity. Problem sets tackled real-world challenges in fields like biology and finance, igniting a yearning to delve deeper.</p><br><br>
                <p>So, I dove back into Harvard's CS50, this time focusing on Web Programming with Python and JavaScript. Frameworks like Django, React, and Bootstrap became my new playground, where I explored the intricate dance of databases, scalability, and user experience. Hands-on projects pushed me to wield APIs like tools, craft interactive UIs that came alive, and master cloud services like GitHub, Heroku, and Vercel. By the end, I was no longer just a student, but a builder, equipped with the principles, languages, and tools to design and deploy impactful applications on the world's vast stage - the internet.</p>

            <div class="about-paragraph">
                <h2>Why Work with Me?</h2>
                <p>My journey began with a spark ignited by CS50, transforming code from lines on a screen to tools shaping the world. I honed my skills in Python, Django, React, and more, tackling real-world challenges from inventory management to interactive UIs. Every project is a chance to craft solutions that empower and simplify, driven by a meticulous passion for user experience and clean code. I'm not just a developer; I'm a collaborator, ready to dive into your vision and translate it into a digital reality that exceeds expectations. Let's build something impactful, together</p>
